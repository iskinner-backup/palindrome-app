# Palindrome App

This is a React web-application that can be used to evaluate whether a given string is a palindrome or not.

The criteria (spec.) for a palindrome can be altered via a pair of UI checkboxes wherein case-sensitivity and the 
removal of whitespaces can be toggled on/off.

---

### Testing

To test this web-application I've utilised [TestCafé](), to run these yourself you will need to install it on your
system `npm i -g testcafe` and run `testcafe firefox test/palindromeTest.js`, depending on your system you may also 
need to update some security privileges for the purposes of screen recording.
